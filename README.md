# GameDownloader
A python script that scrapes the web and downloads a game by your choosing.
I made the script out of boredom and a chance to make my coding skills better.

if you have any suggestions please send them to my email `GregoriousAMWD@proton.me`, or contact me in discord `````Yonatan#6949`````

USAGE: have both files in the same folder and run the script with `python game_downloader.py` in your preffered terminal.
